# Comp_math

It is set of programs for Computational Mathematics on seven topics (see below). A program's number matches a topic's number.

For each program use `Python 3.x`. One should install `matplotlib` и `numpy` to use the most programs.

The description of program's result you can find in the first their strings. 

1. Errors. The program `1_taylor_exp.py` calculates Taylor's series for exponent.

2. Linear systems. The program `2_linear.py` compares Fast Gradient Method and Method of Minimal Residual for N random linear system

3. The method of least squares. The program `3_OLS.py` finds the best degree of aproximal polinomial for exponent and uses it for noisy exponent.

4. Non-linear systems. The program `4_nonlinear.py` includes three parts:
* Show one disadvantages of Newton's Method
* Show how many iterations needs for to find all roots of a random polynomial of constant degree
* Show how work dichotomy for different degrees of polinomial with same number of iteration

5. Interpolation (*one should install only* `sympy`). The programm `5_interpolation.py` creates interpolate Newton's polinomial and cubic spline for set of points in file in.txt(one should create the file).

6. Numerical Integration (*it has not been written yet*)

7. Differential equation (*it has not been written yet*)
