# Comp_math

It is set of programs for Computational Mathematics on seven topics (see below). A program's number matches a topic's number.

For each program use `Python 3.x`. One should install `matplotlib` Ð¸ `numpy` to use the most programs.

The description of program's result you can find in the first their strings. 

1. Errors 

2. Linear systems 

3. The method of least squares 

4. Non-linear systems 

5. Interpolation (*one should install only* `sympy`)

6. Numerical Integration (*it has not been written yet*)

7. Differential equation (*it has not been written yet*)
